# Intelligent Robotics Playground
 A compilation of different tutorials and courseworks from the Intelligent Robotics course. Each directory is a simulation of robots in a space.

## Directory Structure:
### - Controllers
    ### - Behaviour Based Controllers
            - All the following controllers are Behaviour Based Controllers. Which you can use to build the final behaviour based controller for the coursework.
                - epuck_go_forward
                - epuck_go_forward_speed
                - follow_light
                - my_first_controller
                - puck_collision_avoidance
                - supervisor_lab2
    ### - Genetic Algorithm Controllers
            - All the following controllers are Evolutionay Algorithm based Controllers.
                - epuck_python - ER
                - supervisorGA - ER
                
### - Worlds
        - The names of all the worlds are mostly self explainatory however this the name of the file with the default lab 4 world configuration is **`e-puck_Robotics_TMaze_Webots2023.wbt`**.
        - I will try to update the world **`latest by next Tuesday`** or **`positively by Sunday`**.
